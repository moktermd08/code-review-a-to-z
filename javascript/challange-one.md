```javascript
function sqr(n) {
    return n * n;
}

```

**Review:**

Function Name: Rename sqr to square for clarity.
Parameter Check: Ensure n is a number before processing

**Solution:**

Here's a review with a bit more explanation and a revised version of the function based on the suggestions:

**Review:**

1. **Function Name:** It's always good to name functions in a clear and self-explanatory manner. "square" provides a better understanding of the purpose of the function compared to "sqr".

2. **Parameter Check:** For robustness, adding a type check for the input can prevent unexpected results and errors. By ensuring the parameter passed to the function is a number, we can avoid unintended calculations or errors if the function is inadvertently called with non-numeric values.

**Revised Function:**

```javascript
function square(n) {
    if (typeof n !== 'number') {
        throw new TypeError('Expected a number as input');
    }
    return n * n;
}
```


***Commented version***
```javascript
/**
 * Computes the square of a given number.
 * 
 * This function accepts a number as its parameter and returns its square.
 * Before performing the calculation, the function checks if the input is 
 * actually a number to ensure data integrity and prevent potential errors.
 * 
 * @param {number} n - The number to be squared.
 * @returns {number} - The square of the input number.
 * @throws {TypeError} - Throws an error if the input is not a number.
 */
function square(n) {
    // Check if the input parameter is a number
    if (typeof n !== 'number') {
        // Throw a descriptive error if the input is not a number
        throw new TypeError('Expected a number as input');
    }
    
    // Calculate and return the square of the number
    return n * n;
}

```


In the revised function:

- The name of the function is changed from `sqr` to `square` for clarity.

If you think there is a better way to code it please submit your code 
- Before proceeding with the calculation, we've added a check to ensure the parameter `n` is of type number. If it's not, the function throws a descriptive error.
