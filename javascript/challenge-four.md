```javascript
function discount(price) {
    return price - price * 0.1;
}
```

Refactoring: The formula can be simplified to return price * 0.9;.


```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the price after applying a 10% discount.
 * 
 * This function takes the original price as input and returns 
 * the discounted price. A 10% discount is subtracted from 
 * the original price.
 * 
 * @param {number} price - The original price of the item.
 * @returns {number} - Returns the price after the 10% discount is applied.
 */

function discount(price) {
    // Validate that the input is a number
    if (typeof price !== 'number') {
        throw new TypeError('Expected a number for price');
    }

    // Apply a 10% discount by multiplying the price by 0.9
    return price * 0.9;
}

```
