```function sqr(n) {
    return n * n;
}
```

**Review:**

Function Name: Rename sqr to square for clarity.
Parameter Check: Ensure n is a number before processing

**Solution:**

Here's a review with a bit more explanation and a revised version of the function based on the suggestions:

**Review:**

1. **Function Name:** It's always good to name functions in a clear and self-explanatory manner. "square" provides a better understanding of the purpose of the function compared to "sqr".

2. **Parameter Check:** For robustness, adding a type check for the input can prevent unexpected results and errors. By ensuring the parameter passed to the function is a number, we can avoid unintended calculations or errors if the function is inadvertently called with non-numeric values.

**Revised Function:**

```javascript
function square(n) {
    if (typeof n !== 'number') {
        throw new TypeError('Expected a number as input');
    }
    return n * n;
}
```

In the revised function:

- The name of the function is changed from `sqr` to `square` for clarity.
- Before proceeding with the calculation, we've added a check to ensure the parameter `n` is of type number. If it's not, the function throws a descriptive error.
